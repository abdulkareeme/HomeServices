# Home Service Website

This is a platform that connects users and sellers to fulfill all home service needs. Our dedicated team of front-end and back-end developers collaboratively create and maintain a robust website that offers a range of features and functionality. The platform encompasses four distinct account types, namely user, seller, provider, and admin, each tailored to cater to specific roles and responsibilities.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Home Service Website, you need to create an account with one of the available account types. Here's a brief overview of the different account types and their capabilities:

1. **User**: Users can browse services, view detailed information, and rate services after purchasing. To buy a service, users simply fill out the service form and submit it for review.

1. **Seller**: Sellers have the ability to add services to the platform, update or delete them as needed. They can also update their profile information and change their profile images.

1. **Provider**: Providers play a pivotal role by facilitating transactions between sellers and users. They have the authority to charge balance to sellers upon accepting orders, ensuring a seamless payment process.

1. **Admin**: Administrators possess additional privileges, including the ability to charge balance and monitor the total earnings generated across the platform. These features enable admins to maintain financial transparency and support the sustainable growth of the platform.

## Technologies Used

The Home Service Website was built using the following technologies:

- React.js (create-react-app): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Bootstrap: A popular front-end framework built on top of React, providing pre-designed components and responsive layouts.
- React-dom-router: A library for declaratively routing components in React.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- Redux: A state management library for managing the application's global state.
