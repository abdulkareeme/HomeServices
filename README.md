# Home Service Website

This is a platform that connects users and sellers to fulfill all home service needs.
Our dedicated team of front-end and back-end developers collaboratively create and maintain a robust website that offers a range of features and functionality. 
The platform encompasses four distinct account types, namely user, seller, provider, and admin, each tailored to cater to specific roles and responsibilities.
